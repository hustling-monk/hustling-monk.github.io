Hii,

I would not  be writing this blog if I had not spoken to my friend or had not seen a meme about Data science.

I work as Data Scientist as well as very much interested in minute things about life. And this has helped me achieve some god feats in life and this is just starting and life has much more to offer.

Being interested in small minute things helps me delve deeper into data science and Machine learning.

As vivid reader of novels, book from Barack Obama, biography of Steve Jobs and self-help books keeps me motivated.

So this blog is about my experiments in Machine Learning and Data science. Review about some of the books which I read. Some things which keeps me interested.

Life after **Covid-19** will be never be same as before. This global pandemic has changed the people behavior, lifestyle and culture once for all. From healthcare sector to banking sector, from tourism to education, everything has to go through paradigm shift.

Values will change, our lives will change, our working culture will change even our homes will change under this global pandemic.

In this pandemic period we have seen anxiety, panic-buying, foolishness, over-smartness and what not. Lockdown is not the only weapon which can kill this virus. As **Prime Minister Modi** rightly said that we have to learn to live this virus and elaborating his words we have to learn to adopt to the global change we all have to undergo. Social distancing and giving importance to personal hygiene should be our mantra to protect ourselves from this pandemic.

Under this circumstances I have made some predictions on how the things around the world would change.

- **Medical** :

During this global tragedy, the work from this field is very critical. Not only for the treatment of the patients but also for the future of this mighty earth. From Staff nurse to the Doctor and from ventilators to the PPE kits. Everything played and continues to play a major role.

This sector alone would be foundation to several other sectors ion coming days. Like Pharmaceutical companies trying to find vaccines and manufacturing gloves, masks and PPE kit. Every sector would be revolving around this field. As masks and sanitizers has become a crucial part of our life, companies involved in manufacturing these items will emerge soon.

- **Transport and Tourism** :

This will be the worst hit sector. Because there will be less footfalls on the trains, busses or any public transport. To maintain the social distancing norms the companies may accommodate half of the passengers and most might be using their private vehicles mainly cycles to commute to their work place(if allowed).

From 6 months to 1 year from today the tourism and their benefactors will be idle with no jobs. Only limited visitors will be allowed to visit the places with prior booking.

- **Education :**

This sector will undergo drastic changes for long term. As I have read from many articles that schools and colleges will never be same. Classroom will be for limited students at a time and hostel facilities will be provided only for limited students at a time. Most of the schooling and learning will happen over online education. Ah future generation will miss the fun we had at school along with friends.

- **Work culture:**

Since most of the work will done via work from home, waiting in traffic and blaming the Monday morning meeting will be missed. TCS has announced that from 2025 most of their employees will be working from home because 25% efficiency has been achieved in this period since many are working from home.
